# React component: table with pagination

Hello guys, this is one of my part-time projects for learning and exploring React. In this project, you will find a table component developed in React that is capable of rendering dynamic data (no fixed schema). It also incorporates React-router. User can navigate through different tabs. When running in the browser, the project behaves as an SPA (Single Page Application)

## How to run the project

1. Clone the repository (Use `git clone` or download the project zip file)
2. Run command `npm i` to install dependencies
3. On windows, run __startup.bat__ under the top level of directory to boot up the project. On MacOS/Linux, run __startup.sh__ instead.
4. Open your favourite browser and go to the address `http://localhost:3030`
5. You should see the home page of the app in the browser window

As I am relatively new to React, there are inevitably a lot of mistakes and antipatterns used throughout the project. 

This project is open-source, so please feel free to clone / fork the repo if you would like to do so. If you find the project useful, please consider starring the repo or leave some comments, thank you very much for your support!^^
